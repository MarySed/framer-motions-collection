# About

Wanted to mess around with page transitions and text animations using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/).


## How To:

- Run the development server using:

```bash
yarn dev
```

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

- Have fun!


## Special Thanks

This would not have been possible without introductions to Framer Motion from these Youtube channels! Check them out:
